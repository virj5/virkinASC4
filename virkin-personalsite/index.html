        		<h1>The Journey </h1>
        		<p>As a young adolescent, I have been curious on how I would diversify and change the environment around me. As I encounter and face life challenges, I have learned to always give back to those how have helped my journey and celebrate failure. As a young man of color, through Software Engineering, I hope on creating a change the world needs. Here are some interesting facts about me: </p>
				<ul style="margin-top:10px;">
					<li>At age 17, I was accepted into AllStarCode, a non profit organization who were founded on principles to diversify the technology industry for young men of color.</li>
					<li>I enjoy Jazz and Rap Music.</li>
					<li>I am a rising senior at The Metropolitan Soundview Highschool.</li>
					<li>I really enjoy failing and learning from my mistakes</li>
					<li>I really enjoy Stawberry smoothies</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>What Does Code Mean to ME?</h2>

				<em>-"Code is similar to finding freedom in a way. When there are no restains left to hold you down, you are the only person to decide your success and freedom. Thats is where Coding comes along. Your imagination is not limited in order to create greatness.  </em><br/>
				<em>There are moments where you might encounter issues that constantly appear, but it's a new exposure of learning that should not be forgotten about.</em><br/>
				<em>Ever since I was child, I always wondered what my passions would be and how I could use them to my advantage and create change knowing I grew up in a predominately dangerous environment. I'm glad to say that struggling through code has helped me become eager to fail and be proud of who I am. It will help me learn and make mistakes to mold the person I am bound to become. The road is long and it's just the beginning."</em><br/>
				<em>"I am Virkin Jimenez, and I will not stand to become a byproduct of the environment I grew up in."</em> - <br/>
